# dna-converter
This was a coding test given to me by Transcriptic, a Menlo Park, CA based research company.
Explainations for what each file of code is supposed to do is located in the PDF with the assignment. Basically,
the first test takes the way that a machine reads a 96 well plate and converts it to how a human reads a plate. Then it
runs an assertion to test that the code from each function works properly.

The second test takes a file of DNA in a txt form and converts it into RNA and/or an AA chain, depending upon what you feed
the terminal when you call the function.

To run this file, clone the repository to your computer and find the folder in your terminal. Run each file with the
command: 'python <file name>'

The second test requires an input outlined in the PDF file.

Feel free to share feedback!

Thanks!
